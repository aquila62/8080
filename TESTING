Test eko.com to see how the cout and cin interface work.

Usage:

eko

cin is a branch vector in CP/M to read one character from
the keyboard, with wait and with no echo.  The output from
the keyboard is returned in the A register.

cout is a branch vector in CP/M to write one character to
the console, with wrap around and scrolling.  The input to
cout is received in the A register.

Test ascii.com to display the ASCII character set in
rows of 16 characters.

Usage:

ascii

From the output display, it is easy to calculate the
hex value of each character.  The first row begins with
hex 020h, a space.  The last character on the first row
is hex 02fh, a forward slash.  The next row starts with
030h and ends with 03fh, etc.

The program ends after the 7th row is displayed.

Test hx.com to dump memory at a location in hex, specified
by an input parameter.

Usage:

hx address

Example:

hx f000

In this example, Z80 memory is dumped in hex starting at location
0f000h.  16 bytes are dumped on each line, with the current
address as the first word in hex.

The program pauses after each line, waiting for a key to
be pressed on the keyboard.  Hold a key down to cause the
memory dump to proceed continuously.

Terminate the program by entering CTL-Z.

The address parameter defaults to zero.
The error message for an invalid address is "X ?",
where X is an invalid character.
