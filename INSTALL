Unzip the zip file 8080-master.zip

Change directory to 8080-master

chmod 700 *.sh

inst.sh

------------------------------------------------

Installing the yaze 8080/Z80 CP/M 2.2 emulator.

Download the yaze 8080/Z80 CP/M 2.2 emulator from:

ftp://ftp.ping.de/pub/misc/emulators/yaze-1.14.tar.gz

Untar the tarball.

tar xzf yaze-1.14.tar.gz

Change directory to yaze-1.14.

Run the make command.

Makefile creates a program, called yaze.

Run yaze.

You will see the A> prompt.

Type in sys and enter.

That will give you a dollar prompt $>

Enter the command mount b $PATH/8080-master

The directory name, 8080-master, is where your 8080
programs reside.

Enter the command go.

You will see the A> prompt again.

Change disk drive to B:

Run your tests on the B: drive.

You may mount your program directory by editing
the .yazerc file in the yaze-1.14 directory.

After the mount A statement, add a mount B statement.

mount B my_program_directory_path

Save the .yazerc file with your changes.

Run yaze.

Change disk drive to B:

Your programs should be on the B: disk drive.

In CP/M a disk drive is represented by a letter and
a colon.  In emulation the CP/M disk drive is a Linux
directory, also called a Linux folder.

------------------------------------------------

The assembler for this repository is mac80.

The website for downloading this assembler is at:

http://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/ftp/mac80.tgz

Unzip and untar this source package.

Change directory to mac80/src.

Run make.

Run make install.

The make install installs mac80 and m80 in ~/bin.

The make files for the 8080 assembler programs in this
repository show you how the m80 script is invoked to
create a .HEX file.  The hx2c.c program converts the
m80 .HEX output file to a CP/M .COM file.  The script
for doing this conversion is called kom.sh.

Once you have run inst.sh to compile all the programs
and edited .yazerc, you are ready to test with yaze.

This repository contains some elementary programs in Intel 8080
assembler language, which interface with CP/M 2.2.  The programs
are tested with an 8080/Z80 CP/M 2.2 emulator, called yaze-1.14.
The website for downloading yaze is at:

ftp://ftp.ping.de/pub/misc/emulators/yaze-1.14.tar.gz

Extract the files and compile them with the inst.sh script.
De-install with the deinst.sh script.

http://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/ftp/mac80.tgz

See INSTALL for instructions on installing these programs.

See TESTING for a description of tests.
