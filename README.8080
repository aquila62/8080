This repository contains some elementary programs in Intel 8080
assembler language, which interface with CP/M 2.2.  The programs
are tested with an 8080/Z80 CP/M 2.2 emulator, called yaze-1.14.
The website for downloading yaze is at:

ftp://ftp.ping.de/pub/misc/emulators/yaze-1.14.tar.gz

Extract the files and compile them with the inst.sh script.
De-install with the deinst.sh script.

The 8080 assembler for these programs may be downloaded
from:

http://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/ftp/mac80.tgz

See INSTALL for instructions on installing these programs.

See TESTING for a description of tests.
